## Description: This powershell script is designed to run as a scheduled task. 
##              Each time the script runs it will get a list of the virtual machines on the configured VMWare server.
##              Owners of virtual machines which are nearing their expiration date will be informed.
##              A list of Virtual machines, their status and expiration date will be emailed to IT.
